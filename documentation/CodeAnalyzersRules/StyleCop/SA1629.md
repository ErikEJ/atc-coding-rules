### What is the problem

[Issue #28](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-coding-rules/issues/28)

### Decision

We update the `root/.editorconfig` with `severity = none` and a doc-link.

### Reason & arguments

* This rule forms good practice for how to end end with a full stop. But it is not always true that it makes sense, as the example where we have a href link, then a full stop will just make noise. Therefore, we open up for freedom and place the responsibility on the person who writes documentation, to finish the song text in the best possible way.
