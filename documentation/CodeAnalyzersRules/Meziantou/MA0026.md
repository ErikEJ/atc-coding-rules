### What is the problem

[Issue #12](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-coding-rules/issues/11)

### Decision

Disable the rule with `severity = suggestion` in `root/.editorconfig`

And let the team members have to ensure task on the board for TODO's and NotImplementedExecption's
in the end of a sprint.

### Reason & arguments

* In practice, we need TODO's and NotImplementedExecption for situations as scaffold and 'handover code'.
* The code review process should take care of awareness of the TODO's and NotImplementedExecption's in the code.
