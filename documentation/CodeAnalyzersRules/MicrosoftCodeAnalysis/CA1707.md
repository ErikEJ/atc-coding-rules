| ----------- |------------------------------------------------|
| Title       | CA1707 Identifiers should not contain underscores |
| CheckId     | CA1707 |
| Category    | Naming |
| Link        | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/CA1707 |

### What is the problem

[Issue #2](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-coding-rules/issues/2)

### Decision

Just follow the rule for code project - see 'How to fix violations'

We update the `root/.editorconfig` with `severity = error` and a doc-link.
We update the `test/.editorconfig` with `severity = none` and a doc-link.

### Reason & arguments

* We do not like the argument from Microsoft for src projects.
* For test projects we like the options for using underscores in method names.
